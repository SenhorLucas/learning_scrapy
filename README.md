# learning_scrapy

Getting started.
This project uses pipenv to manage packages and virtual environments.
In order to initialize environemnt with python two:
python3 -m pipenv --two

python3 pipenv shell

If the default python 2 is the default in your environment then you should
specifically state python3:

python3 -m pipenv shell

python3 pipenv install

Scrapy seems to require python 2, so you run all pipenv commands on python 3
